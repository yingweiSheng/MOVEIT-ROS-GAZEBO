# EliteDriver Class

## Introduction
The EliteDriver is the main class for data interaction with the robot. It is responsible for establishing all necessary socket connections and handling the data exchange with the robot. The EliteDriver sends control scripts to the robot. After the robot runs the control script, it will establish communication with the EliteDriver, receive motion data, and send the motion results when necessary.

## Header File
```cpp
#include <Elite/EliteDriver.hpp>
```

## Constructor and Destructor

### ***Constructor***
```cpp
EliteDriver(const EliteDriverConfig& config)
```
- ***Function***

    Creates an EliteDriver object and initializes necessary connections for robot communication.  
    This function will throw exceptions in the following cases:  
    1. TCP server creation fails (typically due to port being occupied).
    2. Failed to connect to the robot's primary port.

- ***Parameters***
    - config: Configuration, refer to [Configuration](./EliteDriverConfig.en.md)


### ***Constructor***(Deprecated)
```cpp
EliteDriver::EliteDriver(
    const std::string& robot_ip, 
    const std::string& local_ip, 
    const std::string& script_file,
    bool headless_mode = false, 
    int script_sender_port = 50002, 
    int reverse_port = 50001,
    int trajectory_port = 50003, 
    int script_command_port = 50004, 
    float servoj_time = 0.008,
    float servoj_lookhead_time = 0.1, 
    int servoj_gain = 300, 
    float stopj_acc = 8.0);
```
- ***Function***
Creates an EliteDriver object and initializes the necessary connections for communication with the robot.
- ***Parameters***
    - robot_ip: The IP address of the robot.
    - local_ip: The local IP address.
    - script_file: The template file of the control script.
    - headless_mode: Whether to run in headless mode. After using this mode, there is no need to use the 'External Control' plugin. If this parameter is true, then in the constructor, a control script will be sent to the robot's primary port once.
    - script_sender_port: script_sender_port: Port for sending control scripts. If this port cannot be connected, the `External Control` plugin will stop.
    - reverse_port: The port for reverse communication.
    - trajectory_port: The port for sending trajectory points.
    - script_command_port: The port for sending script commands.
    - servoj_time: The time parameter for servo motion.
    - servoj_lookhead_time: The look-ahead time for servo motion, ranging from [0.03, 0.2] seconds.
    - servoj_gain: The servo gain.
    - stopj_acc: The acceleration for stopping motion (rad/s²).

### ***Destructor***
```cpp
~EliteDriver::EliteDriver()
```
- ***Function***
Releases resources, and the socket will be closed during destruction.

---

## Motion Control

### ***Control Joint Position***
```cpp
bool writeServoj(const vector6d_t& pos, int timeout_ms, bool cartesian = false, bool queue_mode = false)
```
- ***Function***
Sends a servo motion instruction to the robot.
- ***Parameters***
    - pos: The target position.

    - timeout_ms: Sets the timeout for the robot to read the next instruction. If it is less than or equal to 0, it will wait indefinitely.

    - `cartesian`: Set to `true` if sending Cartesian coordinates, `false` for joint-based positions.  
    
    - `queue_mode`: Set to `true` to enable queue mode, `false` otherwise.  
        > **Queue Mode**: In this mode, control commands are queued and executed sequentially. A specified number of commands are pre-stored before motion starts. Note that this introduces additional latency.
- ***Return Value***: Returns true if the instruction is sent successfully, and false if it fails.

---

### ***Control End-effector Velocity***
```cpp
bool writeSpeedl(const vector6d_t& vel, int timeout_ms)
```
- ***Function***
Sends a linear velocity control instruction to the robot.

---

### ***Make the Robot Idle***
```cpp
bool writeIdle(int timeout_ms)
```
- ***Function***
Sends an idle instruction. If the robot is in motion, it will make the robot stop moving.
- ***Parameters***
    - timeout_ms: Sets the timeout for the robot to read the next instruction. If it is less than or equal to 0, it will wait indefinitely.

- ***Parameters***
    - action: Freedrive action, including: START, END, NOOP
    - timeout_ms: Set the timeout for the robot to read the next instruction. If it is less than or equal to 0, it will wait indefinitely.

- *** Note***: After writing the 'START' action, the next instruction needs to be written within the timeout period, which can be written as' NOOP '.

- ***Return Value***: Returns true if the instruction is sent successfully, and false if it fails.
- ***Note***: After writing the `START` action, the next instruction needs to be written within the timeout period, and the `NOOP` can be written.

## Robot Configuration
### ***Zero the Force Sensor***
```cpp
bool zeroFTSensor()
```
- ***Function***
Resets (zeros) the force/torque values measured by the force/torque sensor applied to the tool TCP. The force/torque values are the force/torque vectors obtained by the get_tcp_force(True) script instruction, and these vectors have been processed with load compensation, etc.
After this instruction is executed, the current force/torque measurement value will be saved as the force/torque reference value, and all subsequent force/torque measurement values will be subtracted by this force/torque reference value (zeroed).
Please note that the above force/torque reference value will be updated when this instruction is executed, and will be reset to 0 after the controller is restarted.
- ***Return Value***: Returns true if the instruction is sent successfully, and false if it fails.

---

### ***Set the Tool Voltage***
```cpp
bool setToolVoltage(const ToolVoltage& vol)

### ***Enable the Force Control Mode***
```cpp
bool startForceMode(const vector6d_t& reference_frame, const vector6int32_t& selection_vector, const vector6d_t& wrench, const ForceMode& mode, const vector6d_t& limits)
```
- ***Function***
Enables the force control mode.
- ***Parameters***
    - reference_frame: The pose vector that defines the force control reference coordinate system. This pose vector is defined relative to the base coordinate system. The format is [X,Y,Z,Rx,Ry,Rz], where X, Y, and Z represent the position in meters; Rx, Ry, and Rz represent the pose in radians. Rx, Ry, and Rz are defined using the standard RPY angles. selection_vector: A six-dimensional vector composed of 0s and 1s, used to define the force control axes in the force control coordinate system. 1 represents a force control axis, and 0 represents a non-force control axis.
    - selection_vector: A six-dimensional vector composed of 0s and 1s, used to define the force control axes in the force control coordinate system. 1 represents a force control axis, and 0 represents a non-force control axis.
    - wrench: The target force/torque applied by the robot to the environment. The robot will adjust its pose along/around the force control axes to achieve the specified target force/torque. The format is [Fx,Fy,Fz,Mx,My,Mz], where Fx, Fy, and Fz represent the force applied along the force control axes in Newtons; Mx, My, and Mz represent the torque applied around the force control axes in Newton-meters. This value is invalid for non-force control axes. Due to joint safety limitations, the actual applied force/torque may be lower than the set target force/torque. The actual force/torque applied to the environment can be read using the get_tcp_force script instruction in a separate thread.
    - mode: The force control mode parameter, an integer type data ranging from 0 to 3, used to define the force control mode, that is, how the force control coordinate system is defined or how it is transformed from the force control reference coordinate system.
        - 0: Fixed mode. The force control coordinate system is the force control reference coordinate system.
        - 1: Point mode. The Y-axis of the force control coordinate system points from the origin of the robot TCP to the origin of the force control reference coordinate system.
        - 2: Motion mode. The X-axis of the force control coordinate system is the projection of the TCP movement direction vector on the X-Y plane of the force control reference coordinate system.
    - limits: The speed limit parameter, a six-dimensional vector of float type data. The format is [Vx,Vy,Vz,ωx,ωy,ωz], where Vx, Vy, and Vz represent the maximum allowed TCP speed along the axis in m/s; ωx, ωy, and ωz represent the maximum allowed TCP speed around the axis in rad/s. This speed limit parameter is invalid for non-force control axes, and non-force control axes still execute the original trajectory on that axis.
- ***Return Value***: Returns true if the instruction is sent successfully, and false if it fails.

---

### ***Disable the Force Control Mode***
```cpp
bool endForceMode()
```
- ***Function***
